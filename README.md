## Purpose

This repository contains the resources I employed during the
presentation of two lectures titled *Introduction to R* to Masters
Economics students at the University of Stellenbosch. The aim of the
lectures was to offer a cursory introduction to R, RStudio, and GitHub
to enable students to perform basic operations in a brief amount of
time. Students were also tasked to complete a short assignment.
